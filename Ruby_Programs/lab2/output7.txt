`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre
and gimble in the wabe: All mimsy were
the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe. "Beware
the Jabberwock, my son! The jaws that bite,
the claws that catch! Beware the Jubjub bird,
and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!" He took his
vorpal sword in hand: Long time the manxome
foe he sought -- So rested he by
the Tumtum tree, And stood awhile in thought.
And, as in uffish thought he stood, The
Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through
the tulgey wood, And burbled as it came!
One, two! One, two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! He left it
dead, and with its head He went galumphing
back. "And, has thou slain the Jabberwock? Come
to my arms, my beamish boy! O frabjous
day! Callooh! Callay!' He chortled in his joy.
`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre
and gimble in the wabe; All mimsy were
the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe.
