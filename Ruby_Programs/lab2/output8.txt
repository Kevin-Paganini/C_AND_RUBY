Just like a flame Love burned brightly then
became An empty smoke dream that has gone
Gone with the wind Gone, gone, gone with
the wind Just like a leaf that has
blown away Gone with the wind My romance
has flown away Yesterday's kisses are still, still
on my lips I've had a lifetime of
heaven at my fingertips But now all-all is
gone Gone is the rapture that fills my
heart Gone with the wind The gladness that
filled my heart Just like a flame Love
burned brightly then became An empty smoke dream
that has Gone with the wind Gone with
the wind
